    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    //let age = 100;
    //let age2 = 100;
    //console.log( age, age2 );
    //age = 47;
    //console.log(age, age2);

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
const teams = players;    

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players, teams);

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    teams[3] = 'Lux';
    console.log( players, teams );

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const captain = person;
    captain.number = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const copyObject = Object.assign({}, person, { number: 99 } );

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const captain2 = { ...captain };

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

      console.clear();
      console.log(wes);
